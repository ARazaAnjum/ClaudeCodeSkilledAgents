# Project Intelligence

This project uses **AI Workflow Skills** — a curated set of specialized AI skill definitions and process files to guide you in writing production-grade code.

## Skills Discovery

The `skills/` directory contains skill folders. Each skill has:
- `SKILL.md` — the main skill definition (role, triggers, workflow, constraints, output templates)
- `references/` — supporting documentation, patterns, and code examples

Before working on any task, **check `skills/` for a matching skill**. Read the full `SKILL.md` and relevant references before writing code.

### Skill Matching

Each `SKILL.md` has YAML frontmatter with `triggers` — keywords that indicate when to use that skill. Match the user's request against these triggers:

- React, hooks, JSX, components → `skills/react-expert/`
- Vue, Composition API, Pinia → `skills/vue-expert/`
- Next.js, App Router, Server Components → `skills/nextjs-developer/`
- Python, type hints, async → `skills/python-pro/`
- FastAPI, Pydantic, async API → `skills/fastapi-expert/`
- Django, DRF, ORM → `skills/django-expert/`
- Node.js, Express, NestJS → `skills/nestjs-expert/`
- TypeScript, advanced types → `skills/typescript-pro/`
- Testing, TDD, test suites → `skills/test-master/`
- Database, SQL, queries → `skills/database-optimizer/`
- PostgreSQL → `skills/postgres-pro/`
- Docker, CI/CD, deployment → `skills/devops-engineer/`
- Kubernetes, Helm → `skills/kubernetes-specialist/`
- AWS, GCP, Azure, cloud → `skills/cloud-architect/`
- REST API, GraphQL, OpenAPI → `skills/api-designer/`
- Architecture, system design → `skills/architecture-designer/`
- Code review, PR review → `skills/code-reviewer/`
- Security, vulnerabilities → `skills/security-reviewer/`
- Debugging, errors, logs → `skills/debugging-wizard/`

If the task spans multiple domains, read multiple skills. Prioritize the most specific skill first.

### Using a Skill

When you identify a matching skill:

1. Read the full `SKILL.md` file
2. Read relevant files in `references/` for the specific sub-topic
3. Follow the skill's Core Workflow steps
4. Apply the MUST DO / MUST NOT DO constraints
5. Use the output templates for consistent formatting

## Process Files

The `ai-workflow/process/` directory contains workflow templates:

- `create-prd.md` — How to create a Product Requirements Document. Use when the user wants to plan a new feature. Ask clarifying questions, then generate a structured PRD and save it to `/tasks/[feature-name]/prd-[feature-name].md`.
- `generate-tasks.md` — How to break a PRD into development tasks. Use after a PRD is created. Generate a numbered task list and save to `/tasks/[feature-name]/tasks-[feature-name].md`.
- `process-task-list.md` — How to work through a task list. Use when implementing tasks from a generated list. Process tasks one at a time, verify each before moving on.

## Coding Rules

The `ai-workflow/rules/` directory contains coding standards. Always check for applicable rules before writing code.

- `common-rules/` — Universal standards that apply to all code (development practices, usage standards)
- `framework-specific-rules/` — Rules for specific frameworks (React, Vue, Laravel, Flutter, Node.js, React Native, Next.js + Supabase)

If a framework-specific rule exists for the current tech stack, read and follow it.

## Workflow

When the user asks you to build something:

1. Identify the tech stack from the request and existing project files
2. Read matching skills from `skills/` (check SKILL.md + references)
3. Read applicable rules from `ai-workflow/rules/`
4. Follow the process — if it's a new feature, start with the PRD process; if tasks exist, follow the task list process
5. Write code following the skill's workflow, constraints, and output templates
6. Review against the skill's MUST DO / MUST NOT DO lists
