# Vue.js Frontend Development Rules

This file serves as a reference for the distributed Vue.js frontend rules. The rules are organized into focused files for better maintainability and context-specific application.

## Rule Files Overview

### Core Rules (Always Applied)
- **core-vue.mdc** - Fundamental Vue.js standards, conventions, and integration patterns

### Component Development
- **component-patterns.mdc** - Component structure, patterns, and implementation examples
- **performance-patterns.mdc** - Performance optimization and advanced patterns
- **forms-api.mdc** - Form handling, API integration, and error handling

### Integration Patterns
- **blade-integration.mdc** - Laravel Blade + Vue.js integration patterns

## Quick Reference

### Essential Patterns
- Use Single File Components (.vue files) with proper structure
- Implement Blade + Vue integration with json_encode for data passing
- Handle Laravel boolean strings properly in Vue components
- Use Bootstrap Vue components for consistent UI
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use computed properties for expensive operations
- Implement pagination and lazy loading for performance
- Use event bus for cross-component communication
- Follow proper lifecycle management and cleanup

### File Organization
```
resources/js/
├── components/          # Vue components organized by feature
├── utils/              # Utility functions and helpers
├── mixins/             # Reusable component mixins
└── app.js              # Main application entry point

resources/views/
└── [feature]/          # Blade templates with Vue component integration
```

### Key Integration Points
- Pass Laravel data via props with proper boolean conversion
- Use team/tenant context for multi-tenant applications
- Implement proper permission handling
- Use helper functions for common data formatting
- Handle API responses consistently

For detailed rules and examples, refer to the specific rule files based on your current development context.
