## 📦 Install

### Option 1: Marketplace Install (Recommended)

Install via the **Claude Code plugin marketplace** — the easiest way to get started.

```bash
# 1. Register the marketplace (one-time)
claude plugin marketplace add ARazaAnjum/ClaudeCodeSkilledAgents

# 2. Install the full plugin (all 70 skills)
claude plugin install ai-workflow-skills@claude-skilled-agents
```

**Or install only the skills you need:**

```bash
claude plugin install ai-workflow-skills-frontend@claude-skilled-agents     # 10 frontend skills
claude plugin install ai-workflow-skills-backend@claude-skilled-agents      # 17 backend skills
claude plugin install ai-workflow-skills-devops@claude-skilled-agents       # 7 DevOps skills
claude plugin install ai-workflow-skills-database@claude-skilled-agents     # 5 database skills
claude plugin install ai-workflow-skills-testing@claude-skilled-agents      # 6 testing skills
claude plugin install ai-workflow-skills-architecture@claude-skilled-agents # 4 architecture skills
claude plugin install ai-workflow-skills-ai-ml@claude-skilled-agents        # 4 AI/ML skills
claude plugin install ai-workflow-skills-specialized@claude-skilled-agents  # 8 specialized skills
claude plugin install ai-workflow-skills-utilities@claude-skilled-agents    # 7 utility skills
```

**Manage your installation:**

```bash
claude plugin update ai-workflow-skills      # Update to latest
claude plugin disable ai-workflow-skills     # Temporarily disable
claude plugin enable ai-workflow-skills      # Re-enable
claude plugin uninstall ai-workflow-skills   # Remove
```

### Option 2: Plugin via Git Clone

Clone the repo and load directly — useful for development or if you prefer manual control.

**Quick start (one command):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARazaAnjum/ClaudeCodeSkilledAgents.git ~/.claude/plugins/ai-workflow-skills
claude --plugin-dir ~/.claude/plugins/ai-workflow-skills
```

**Or clone anywhere and point to it:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARazaAnjum/ClaudeCodeSkilledAgents.git
claude --plugin-dir ./ClaudeCodeSkilledAgents
```

> **Tip:** Add `--plugin-dir` to your shell alias for permanent use:
> ```bash
> # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
> alias claude='claude --plugin-dir ~/.claude/plugins/ai-workflow-skills'
> ```

**To update later:**

```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins/ai-workflow-skills && git pull
```

**Available slash commands once loaded:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ai-workflow-skills:create-prd [feature]` | Generate a Product Requirements Document |
| `/ai-workflow-skills:generate-tasks [prd-path]` | Break a PRD into development tasks |
| `/ai-workflow-skills:process-tasks [task-path]` | Work through a task list step by step |

All 70 skills auto-trigger based on your task — just ask a question and Claude picks the right expert.

### Option 2: CLI Setup

Install the CLI globally and scaffold skills into any project:

```bash
npm install -g ai-workflow-skills
```

### Option 3: CLI with Plugin Mode

The CLI also supports installing as a plugin into your project:

```bash
skills setup
```

When you select **Claude**, choose between:

| Mode | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Plugin** | Copies `.claude-plugin/`, `skills/`, `ai-workflow/`, `commands/`, and `CLAUDE.md` — ready to use with `claude --plugin-dir .` |
| **Normal skillset** | Interactive skill selection — pick only the skills you need |

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup

The CLI supports **three agents** — choose yours at startup:

| | Cursor | Claude (Normal) | Claude (Plugin) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Project intelligence** | `cursor.mdc` | `CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.md` |
| **Base rules & standards** | `ai-workflow/` | `ai-workflow/` | `ai-workflow/` |
| **Skills** | `ai-workflow/skills/` (selected) | `skills/` (selected) | `skills/` (all 70) |
| **Slash commands** | — | — | `commands/` |
| **Plugin manifest** | — | — | `.claude-plugin/` |

Run from **any project directory**:

```bash
skills setup
```

The CLI first asks which AI agent you use, then walks you through the setup:

### Cursor flow

```

## 🔌 Claude Code Plugin

This project is also available as a **Claude Code plugin**. Instead of copying skills into your project, you can load them directly into Claude Code.

### Install as a plugin (local)

```bash
# Load directly from a local clone
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/ai-workflow-skills
```

### Install from marketplace

```bash
# If published to a marketplace
claude plugin install ai-workflow-skills
```

### What you get

Once installed, the plugin provides:

- **70 auto-triggered skills** (68 user-invocable + 2 background) — Claude automatically uses the right skill based on your task (React, Python, DevOps, etc.)
- **3 slash commands** for structured workflows:
  - `/ai-workflow-skills:create-prd` — Generate a Product Requirements Document
  - `/ai-workflow-skills:generate-tasks` — Break a PRD into development tasks
  - `/ai-workflow-skills:process-tasks` — Work through a task list step by step
- **Development rules** — Coding standards applied automatically as background knowledge

### Plugin structure

├── dist/plugins/                # Generated category plugins (built output)
└── README.md
```

### Testing the plugin

```bash
# Start Claude Code with the plugin loaded
claude --plugin-dir .

# Try a slash command
/ai-workflow-skills:create-prd my-new-feature

# Or just ask a question — skills trigger automatically
> Help me build a React component with sorting
# → Claude loads react-expert skill automatically
```

### Category Plugins

Don't need all 70 skills? Install only the category you need:

```bash
# Build category plugins first
npm run build:plugins

# Then load a specific category
claude --plugin-dir ./dist/plugins/frontend
claude --plugin-dir ./dist/plugins/backend
claude --plugin-dir ./dist/plugins/devops
```

| Category | Plugin Name | Skills |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Frontend | `ai-workflow-skills-frontend` | 10 + 2 background |
| Backend | `ai-workflow-skills-backend` | 17 + 2 background |
| DevOps | `ai-workflow-skills-devops` | 7 + 2 background |
| Database | `ai-workflow-skills-database` | 5 + 2 background |
| Testing | `ai-workflow-skills-testing` | 6 + 2 background |
| Architecture | `ai-workflow-skills-architecture` | 4 + 2 background |
| AI/ML | `ai-workflow-skills-ai-ml` | 4 + 2 background |
| Specialized | `ai-workflow-skills-specialized` | 8 + 2 background |
| Utilities | `ai-workflow-skills-utilities` | 7 + 2 background |

Each category plugin includes the 2 background skills (`ai-workflow-context` and `development-standards`) plus 3 slash commands automatically.

## 🧠 How It Works

### CLAUDE.md — Project Intelligence

The `CLAUDE.md` file is read by Claude at the start of every conversation. It tells Claude to:

- **Scan `skills/`** for a matching skill based on trigger keywords in your request
- **Read the full `SKILL.md`** and `references/` before writing any code
- **Follow `ai-workflow/rules/`** coding standards for your tech stack
- **Use `ai-workflow/process/`** workflows for feature planning (PRD → tasks → implementation)

### Skills — How Claude Matches Them

Each skill has YAML frontmatter with `triggers`. Claude automatically matches your request:

| You ask about… | Claude reads… |
|---|---|
| React, hooks, JSX, components | `skills/react-expert/` |
| Vue, Composition API, Pinia | `skills/vue-expert/` |
| Next.js, App Router, RSC | `skills/nextjs-developer/` |
| Python, type hints, async | `skills/python-pro/` |
| FastAPI, Pydantic | `skills/fastapi-expert/` |
| Django, DRF, ORM | `skills/django-expert/` |
| TypeScript, advanced types | `skills/typescript-pro/` |
| Testing, TDD | `skills/test-master/` |
| PostgreSQL, SQL, queries | `skills/postgres-pro/` |
| Docker, CI/CD, deployment | `skills/devops-engineer/` |
| Kubernetes, Helm | `skills/kubernetes-specialist/` |
| AWS, GCP, Azure | `skills/cloud-architect/` |
| REST API, GraphQL, OpenAPI | `skills/api-designer/` |
| Architecture, system design | `skills/architecture-designer/` |
| Security, vulnerabilities | `skills/security-reviewer/` |
| Debugging, errors | `skills/debugging-wizard/` |

Each matched skill gives Claude: a role definition, a 5-step workflow, reference docs, MUST DO / MUST NOT DO constraints, and output templates.

### ai-workflow/ — Rules & Process

**Process files** give Claude structured workflows:

| File | When to use |
|---|---|
| `create-prd.md` | User wants to plan a new feature — Claude asks clarifying questions, generates a PRD |
| `generate-tasks.md` | After a PRD exists — Claude breaks it into numbered dev tasks |
| `process-task-list.md` | During implementation — Claude works through tasks one at a time |

**Rule files** enforce coding standards:

| Rules | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `common-rules/` | Universal development standards, cursor usage |
| `framework-specific-rules/react.mdc` | React component patterns, hooks, state |
| `framework-specific-rules/vue/` | Vue 3, Composition API, Pinia |
| `framework-specific-rules/laravel/` | Laravel architecture, Eloquent, APIs |
| `framework-specific-rules/flutter/` | Flutter widgets, BLoC, Riverpod |
| `framework-specific-rules/nodejs.mdc` | Node.js patterns |
| `framework-specific-rules/reactNative.mdc` | React Native mobile |
| `framework-specific-rules/nextjs-supabase-auth.mdc` | Next.js + Supabase auth |

## 🔧 CLI Reference

### Commands

```bash
skills setup                    # Interactive 3-step project setup (default)
skills list                     # Print all 69 available skills
skills list --search python     # Filter by name
skills --version                # Show version
skills --help                   # Show help
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build:plugins            # Generate 9 category sub-plugins in dist/plugins/
```

### Setup flags

```bash
skills setup --dry-run          # Preview what would be copied — writes nothing
skills setup --force            # Overwrite existing folders without asking
skills setup --all              # Copy all 69 skills without the checkbox prompt
skills setup --search react     # Pre-filter the skill list before selecting
```

### Conflict handling

If a folder or file already exists in your project you will be prompted to choose:
- **Overwrite** — replaces the existing folder/file
- **Skip** — leaves it untouched
- **Rename** — copies as `<name>-1`, `<name>-2`, etc.

## 📚 Using Skills Directly

### Using Skills in Claude

Reference any skill directly in your Claude conversation:

```
@react-expert
Help me build a data table component with sorting and filtering

@python-pro
Create a type-safe async API client

@devops-engineer
Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
```

### Using Agent CLI

```bash
# List all agents
node agents/cli.js list

# Search for agents
node agents/cli.js search react

# Get agent info
node agents/cli.js info react-expert

# Show statistics
node agents/cli.js stats

# Get recommendations
node agents/cli.js recommend web-app
```

### Using TypeScript Agents

```typescript
import { react_expertAgent } from './agents/typescript/react-expert.agent';

// Check if agent matches
if (react_expertAgent.shouldTrigger('build a React component')) {
  // Execute the agent
  const result = await react_expertAgent.execute({
    task: 'Create sortable data table',
    requirements: ['TypeScript', 'Responsive']
  });
}
```

### Using Agent Router

```typescript
import AgentRouter from './agents/typescript/agent-router';

const router = new AgentRouter();

// Automatically find and execute the best agent
await router.route('Help me optimize my PostgreSQL queries');
// → Routes to: postgres-pro
```

await router.route('Build FastAPI application with async endpoints');

// Testing phase
await router.route('Create comprehensive test suite with pytest');

// Deployment phase
await router.route('Set up CI/CD pipeline with Docker and Kubernetes');
```

### Example 2: Finding the Right Agent

```typescript
// Search by technology
router.searchAgents('react');
router.searchAgents('kubernetes');
router.searchAgents('database');

// Filter by role
router.getAgentsByRole('architect');

// Filter by scope
router.getAgentsByScope('implementation');

// Get specific agent
const agent = router.getAgent('react-expert');
```

### Example 3: Using CLI

```bash
# List all frontend agents
node agents/cli.js list --search=frontend

# Get recommendations for web app
node agents/cli.js recommend web-app

# Show agent details
node agents/cli.js info react-expert

# View statistics
node agents/cli.js stats
```
